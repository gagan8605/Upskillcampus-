Overview

This project aims to develop and deploy a machine learning model to predict traffic patterns in a smart city. By leveraging various data sources, including historical traffic data, weather conditions, and city events, the model provides accurate traffic forecasts. This helps in efficient urban planning, traffic management, and reducing congestion.


Features


Data Collection: Integrates data from multiple sources such as traffic cameras, GPS data, weather APIs, and event schedules.

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses raw data for analysis, including handling missing values and normalizing datasets.

Feature Engineering: Extracts meaningful features from raw data to improve model accuracy.

Model Training: Uses various machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM for time-series forecasting.

Model Evaluation: Assesses model performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and RÂ².

Visualization: Provides visualization tools to display traffic predictions and historical data trends.

Project Structure


data/: Contains raw and processed datasets.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and experimentation.

scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment.

models/: Trained models and model artifacts.
